- Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (if needed).

4.Dashboard Design & Development
- Select key KPIs and visuals (charts, tables, filters, etc.).
- Design an interactive Power BI dashboard for better insights.

5.Analysis & Insights
- Identify trends in profit, revenue, and expenses.
- Compare performance across products, regions, and time periods.

6.Report Validation & Testing
- Check for data accuracy and consistency.
- Ensure all visualizations display the correct insights.

## Project Insights
- Revenue Growth – Revenue is increasing, but expenses impact overall profitability.
- Profit Margins – Some products/services have low margins, requiring cost optimization.
- Top Products – Certain products drive the majority of profits, while others underperform.
- Regional Performance – Some regions are highly profitable, while others struggle with high costs.
- Customer Segmentation – High-value customers contribute most to profits, while some segments are unprofitable.
- Seasonal Trends – Profitability fluctuates based on seasonal demand.

## Final Conclusion:
The Profit Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into revenue, expenses, and overall profitability. It helps identify top-performing products, profitable regions, and customer segments contributing the most to business growth. The analysis highlights key areas where costs can be optimized to improve profit margins. Seasonal trends and sales fluctuations indicate opportunities for better financial planning.
