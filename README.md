# Profit_Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
The objective of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze and visualize the profit performance of the business. It provides insights into key financial metrics, including revenue, expenses, and net profit across different time periods, product categories, and regions. The dashboard helps stakeholders identify trends, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall profitability by making data-driven decisions.

2.Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
- Convert raw data into structured tables for analysis.

3.Data Modeling
- Establish relationships between different tables (Sales, Expenses, Products, Regions, etc.).
- Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (if needed).

4.Dashboard Design & Development
- Select key KPIs and visuals (charts, tables, filters, etc.).
- Design an interactive Power BI dashboard for better insights.

5.Analysis & Insights
- Identify trends in profit, revenue, and expenses.
- Compare performance across products, regions, and time periods.

6.Report Validation & Testing
- Check for data accuracy and consistency.
- Ensure all visualizations display the correct insights.
